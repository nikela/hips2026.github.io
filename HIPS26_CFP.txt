[Introduction]
The 31st HIPS workshop, to be held as a full-day meeting at the IPDPS 2026 conference in New Orleans, Louisiana, USA, focuses on high-level programming of multiprocessors, compute clusters, and massively parallel machines. Like previous workshops in this series — established in 1996 — this event serves as a forum for research in the areasof parallel applications, language design, compilers, runtime systems, and programming tools. It provides a timely forum for scientists and engineers to present the latest ideas and findings in these rapidly changing fields. In our call for papers, we especially invite papers demonstrating innovative approaches in the areas of emerging programming models for largescale parallel systems and many-core architectures.

[Topics of the workshop]
Topics of interest to the HIPS workshop include but are not limited to:

    - High-level and domain-specific programming systems
    - Language/compiler support for AI/ML and Cybersecurity/Privacy (e.g., ML-based autotuning)
    - Application of Large Language Models in highlevel programming environments
    - Higher-level programming support for quantum computing/quantum simulation
    - Programming Models and Tools for the EdgeCloud-HPC Continuum  
    - (Scalable) programming tools and tools for power & performance analysis, modeling, monitoring and debugging, and core correctness
    - Compiler analysis and optimization techniques
    - OS and architectural support for parallel programming and debugging
    - Software and system support for extreme scalability including fault tolerance and poweraware HPC
    - Programming environments for heterogeneous multicore systems and accelerators such as GPUs and FPGAs
    - Solutions for programming paradigms for GPUs from different hardware vendors
    - Performance portability
    - Efforts for improving the sustainability of scientific software
    - Languages and runtime support for multiscience/coupled codes, including but not limited to ensemble computing and uncertainty quantification
    - Static and dynamic analysis for bug detection of parallel and distributed programs.

[Manuscript submission]
Authors are invited to submit original papers in two separate tracks:
	- Full papers may not exceed 10 single-spaced double-column pages using 10-point size font on 8.5x11 inch pages (IEEE conference style), including figures, tables, and references. The authors, if accepted, will have the opportunity to present their work during the workshop.
	- Short papers may not exceed 4 single-spaced double-column pages using 10-point size font on 8.5x11 inch pages (IEEE conference style), including figures, tables, and references. The authors, if accepted, will have the opportunity to give a short presentation during the workshop.
All submissions should be formatted according to the IPDPS paper style (IEEE conference style, single-blind).

Please submit papers through the IPDPS-HIPS EasyChair site: 
https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=hips2026

[Proceedings]
The accepted full papers will be published in the IPDPS 2026 Workshops proceedings by the IEEE Xplore Digital Library.
(Short papers will not appear in the proceedings.)
Presentation of an accepted paper at the conference is a requirement of publication.
Any paper that is not presented at the conference will not be included in IEEE Xplore.
